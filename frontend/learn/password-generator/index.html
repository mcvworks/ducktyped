            <h1>Password Security Explained</h1>
            <p class="standalone-intro">Understand how password entropy determines strength, learn how attackers crack passwords, follow modern best practices from NIST, and generate cryptographically secure passwords with duckTyped's password generator.</p>

            <h2>Why Passwords Matter</h2>
            <p>Passwords remain the most widely used authentication method on the internet. Despite the rise of biometrics, hardware keys, and passwordless authentication, the vast majority of online accounts -- email, banking, social media, cloud services -- are protected by passwords. A weak password is the single easiest way for an attacker to gain unauthorized access to your accounts and data.</p>
            <p>The scale of the problem is staggering. Billions of username-password pairs have been leaked in data breaches over the past decade. Attackers compile these into massive dictionaries and use automated tools to test stolen credentials against thousands of services simultaneously. If you reuse a password across multiple sites, a breach at one service can compromise all of them.</p>

            <h2>Password Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Entropy</strong> is the mathematical measure of a password's unpredictability, expressed in bits. The higher the entropy, the more guesses an attacker must make to crack the password by brute force. The formula for calculating entropy is:</p>
            <pre><code>Entropy (bits) = log2(pool_size ^ length)
               = length * log2(pool_size)</code></pre>
            <p>Where <strong>pool_size</strong> is the number of possible characters in each position and <strong>length</strong> is the number of characters in the password. For example, a 12-character password using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and 32 special characters has a pool size of 94 and an entropy of:</p>
            <pre><code>12 * log2(94) = 12 * 6.55 = 78.6 bits</code></pre>

            <h3>Character Pools and Entropy per Character</h3>
            <p>The entropy contributed by each character depends on the size of the character pool:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Character Set</th><th>Pool Size</th><th>Bits per Character</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Digits only (0-9)</td><td>10</td><td>3.32</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Lowercase letters (a-z)</td><td>26</td><td>4.70</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Lowercase + uppercase (a-z, A-Z)</td><td>52</td><td>5.70</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)</td><td>62</td><td>5.95</td></tr>
                <tr><td>All printable ASCII</td><td>94</td><td>6.55</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>As a general guideline, passwords with fewer than 40 bits of entropy are considered weak, 40 to 60 bits are moderate, 60 to 80 bits are strong, and anything above 80 bits is very strong. Modern security recommendations typically aim for at least 70-80 bits of entropy.</p>

            <h2>How Attackers Crack Passwords</h2>
            <p>Understanding attack methods is essential for creating passwords that resist them. Here are the most common techniques:</p>

            <h3>Brute Force Attacks</h3>
            <p>A <strong>brute force attack</strong> systematically tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. The time required depends on the password's entropy and the attacker's hardware. Modern GPUs can compute billions of hash attempts per second. A password with 40 bits of entropy (about 1 trillion combinations) can be cracked in seconds on commodity hardware, while a password with 80 bits of entropy would take millions of years.</p>

            <h3>Dictionary Attacks</h3>
            <p>Rather than trying every combination, a <strong>dictionary attack</strong> tests a precompiled list of common passwords, words, phrases, and known patterns. These dictionaries include millions of entries compiled from leaked password databases, common substitutions (like <code>p@ssw0rd</code>), and keyboard patterns (like <code>qwerty123</code>). Dictionary attacks are far more efficient than brute force because they exploit the fact that humans tend to choose predictable passwords.</p>

            <h3>Credential Stuffing</h3>
            <p><strong>Credential stuffing</strong> uses username-password pairs stolen from one data breach to attempt login at other services. Because many users reuse passwords across sites, attackers can compromise accounts at unrelated services using previously leaked credentials. Automated tools can test millions of credential pairs against a target service in a matter of hours.</p>

            <h3>Rainbow Tables</h3>
            <p>A <strong>rainbow table</strong> is a precomputed lookup table that maps password hashes back to their plaintext equivalents. Instead of hashing each guess in real time, an attacker compares a stolen hash against the table for an instant match. Rainbow tables are effective against unsalted hashes (where the same password always produces the same hash). Modern systems defend against this by using <strong>salted hashes</strong> -- appending a random value to each password before hashing, making precomputed tables useless.</p>

            <h2>Common Password Mistakes</h2>
            <p>These are the patterns attackers check first:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Short passwords</strong> -- anything under 8 characters can be brute-forced in seconds to minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Dictionary words</strong> -- single English words, names, and common phrases are in every attack dictionary.</li>
                <li><strong>Predictable substitutions</strong> -- replacing <code>a</code> with <code>@</code>, <code>o</code> with <code>0</code>, or <code>s</code> with <code>$</code> does not meaningfully increase security. Attackers include these variations in their dictionaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Keyboard patterns</strong> -- sequences like <code>qwerty</code>, <code>123456</code>, <code>asdfgh</code>, and <code>zxcvbn</code> are among the most commonly used passwords worldwide.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal information</strong> -- birthdays, pet names, phone numbers, and addresses are easily discovered through social media or public records.</li>
                <li><strong>Password reuse</strong> -- using the same password across multiple services means a single breach compromises all of them.</li>
                <li><strong>Appending numbers or years</strong> -- adding <code>123</code> or <code>2024</code> to the end of a weak password does not make it strong.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Password Length vs. Complexity</h2>
            <p>There is a widespread misconception that complexity (mixing uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols) matters more than length. In reality, <strong>length has a far greater impact on entropy than complexity</strong>. Consider these comparisons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An 8-character password using all 94 printable ASCII characters: <code>8 * 6.55 = 52.4 bits</code></li>
                <li>A 16-character password using only lowercase letters: <code>16 * 4.70 = 75.2 bits</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The longer, simpler password is significantly stronger. This is why modern guidelines emphasize length over arbitrary complexity requirements. A long passphrase made of random words is both more secure and easier to remember than a short, complex string of characters.</p>

            <h2>NIST Guidelines (SP 800-63B)</h2>
            <p>The <strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</strong> publishes password guidelines in Special Publication 800-63B that have significantly shifted industry best practices. Key recommendations include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minimum length of 8 characters</strong>, with a recommended minimum of 15 characters for higher security. Systems should support passwords of at least 64 characters.</li>
                <li><strong>No composition rules</strong> -- NIST advises against requiring specific character types (uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol) because these rules lead to predictable patterns and user frustration without meaningfully improving security.</li>
                <li><strong>No mandatory password rotation</strong> -- forced periodic password changes (every 30 or 90 days) cause users to choose weaker passwords and make minimal, predictable modifications. Passwords should only be changed when there is evidence of compromise.</li>
                <li><strong>Check against breached password lists</strong> -- new passwords should be screened against databases of known compromised passwords and rejected if found.</li>
                <li><strong>No password hints or knowledge-based questions</strong> -- these weaken security by providing attackers with clues.</li>
                <li><strong>Support paste functionality</strong> -- password fields should allow pasting from clipboard to encourage the use of password managers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Passphrases</h2>
            <p>A <strong>passphrase</strong> is a password composed of multiple random words, such as <code>correct horse battery staple</code>. Passphrases leverage length to achieve high entropy while remaining memorable. A 4-word passphrase chosen from a dictionary of 7,776 words (as in the Diceware method) provides approximately 51.7 bits of entropy. A 6-word passphrase from the same dictionary provides about 77.5 bits -- sufficient for most applications.</p>
            <p>The key requirement is that the words must be chosen <strong>randomly</strong>, not selected by the user. Humans are poor at generating random sequences, and phrases that seem random to us (like song lyrics or movie quotes) are easily guessed by attackers who include common phrases in their dictionaries.</p>

            <h2>Password Managers</h2>
            <p>A <strong>password manager</strong> is a tool that generates, stores, and auto-fills unique, high-entropy passwords for each of your accounts. You protect all stored passwords with a single strong master password or passphrase. Password managers solve the fundamental problem of password security: the need to use a unique, complex password for every service without being able to memorize them all.</p>
            <p>Reputable password managers include 1Password, Bitwarden, KeePassXC, and Dashlane. Most browsers also include built-in password managers, though dedicated tools typically offer stronger features like breach monitoring and secure sharing.</p>

            <h2>Two-Factor and Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA / MFA)</h2>
            <p><strong>Two-factor authentication (2FA)</strong> adds a second verification step beyond your password. Even if an attacker obtains your password, they cannot access your account without the second factor. Common second factors include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)</strong> -- apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password generate 6-digit codes that change every 30 seconds.</li>
                <li><strong>Hardware security keys</strong> -- physical devices like YubiKey or Titan Security Key that use the FIDO2/WebAuthn protocol. These are the most phishing-resistant option.</li>
                <li><strong>SMS codes</strong> -- a one-time code sent via text message. While better than no 2FA, SMS is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks and should be considered the weakest option.</li>
                <li><strong>Push notifications</strong> -- authentication apps that send a push notification to your phone for approval.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Enabling 2FA on all critical accounts (email, banking, cloud services, social media) is one of the most impactful steps you can take to protect your online security.</p>

            <h2>How to Use the Password Generator</h2>
            <p>The duckTyped Password Generator creates cryptographically secure passwords directly in your browser:</p>
